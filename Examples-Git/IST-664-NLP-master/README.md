# IST-664-NLP

### Description:
This repository is designed to develop an understanding of how Natural Language Processing (NLP)
can process written text and produce a linguistic analysis that can be used in other applications

### Learning Objective:
* Demonstrate the levels of linguistic analysis, the computational techniques used to
understand text at each level and what the challenges are for those techniques
* Process text through the language levels using the resources of the Natural Language
Toolkit (NLTK) and some rudimentary use of the programming language Python
* Describe how NLP is used in many types of real world applications.

### Homework(folder):
* HW1 - Exercise on getting general corpus statistics. 
* HW2 - Exercise on Syntactic structure analysis of the texts. 
* HW3 - Exercise on Comparing the baseline performance of using just word features with some modified or additional features.
